        A helicopter is a type of rotorcraft in which lift and thrust are supplied
        by horizontally spinning rotors. This allows the helicopter to take off
        and land vertically, to hover, and to fly forward, backward and laterally.
        These attributes allow helicopters to be used in congested or isolated
        areas where fixed-wing aircraft and many forms of STOL (Short TakeOff and
        Landing) or STOVL (Short TakeOff and Vertical Landing) aircraft cannot
        perform without a runway.

        <p><dd>The number, size and type of engine(s) used on a helicopter determines the
            size, function and capability of that helicopter design. The earliest
            helicopter engines were simple mechanical devices, such as rubber bands or
            spindles, which relegated the size of helicopters to toys and small
            models. For a half century before the first airplane flight, steam engines
            were used to forward the development of the understanding of helicopter
            aerodynamics, but the limited power did not allow for manned flight. The
            introduction of the internal combustion engine at the end of the 19th
            century became the watershed for helicopter development as engines began
            to be developed and produced that were powerful enough to allow for
            helicopters able to lift humans.Early helicopter designs utilized
            custom-built engines or rotary engines designed for airplanes, but these
            were soon replaced by more powerful automobile engines and radial engines.
            The single, most-limiting factor of helicopter development during the
            first half of the 20th century was that the amount of power produced by an
            engine was not able to overcome the engine's weight in vertical flight.
            This was overcome in early successful helicopters by using the smallest
            engines available. When the compact, flat engine was developed, the
            helicopter industry found a lighter-weight powerplant easily adapted to
            small helicopters, although radial engines continued to be used for larger
            helicopters.

                The rotor system, or more simply rotor, is the rotating part of a
      helicopter that generates lift. A rotor system may be mounted
      horizontally, as main rotors are, providing lift vertically, or it may be
      mounted vertically, such as a tail rotor, to provide horizontal thrust to
      counteract torque from the main rotors. The rotor consists of a mast, hub
      and rotor blades. The mast is a cylindrical metal shaft that extends
      upwards from the transmission. At the top of the mast is the attachment
      point for the rotor blades called the hub. Main rotor systems are
      classified according to how the rotor blades are attached and move
      relative to the hub. There are three basic types: hingeless, fully
      articulated, and teetering; although some modern rotor systems use a
      combination of these.Turbine engines revolutionized the aviation industry;
      and the turboshaft engine for helicopter use, pioneered in December 1951
      by the aforementioned Kaman K-225, finally gave helicopters an engine with
      a large amount of power and a low weight penalty. Turboshafts are also
      more reliable than piston engines, especially when producing the sustained
      high levels of power required by a helicopter. The turboshaft engine was
      able to be scaled to the size of the helicopter being designed, so that
      all but the lightest of helicopter models are powered by turbine engines
      today.</p>

                A helicopter has four flight control inputs. These are the cyclic, the
                collective, the anti-torque pedals, and the throttle. The cyclic control
                is usually located between the pilot's legs and is commonly called the
                cyclic stick or just cyclic. On most helicopters, the cyclic is similar to
                a joystick. However, the Robinson R22 and Robinson R44 have a unique
                teetering bar cyclic control system and a few helicopters have a cyclic
                control that descends into the cockpit from overhead. The control is
                called the cyclic because it changes cyclic pitch of the main blades. The
                result is to tilt the rotor disk in a particular direction, resulting in
                the helicopter moving in that direction. If the pilot pushes the cyclic
                forward, the rotor disk tilts forward, and the rotor produces a thrust in
                the forward direction. If the pilot pushes the cyclic to the side, the
                rotor disk tilts to that side and produces thrust in that direction,
                causing the helicopter to hover sideways. The collective pitch control or
                collective is located on the left side of the pilot's seat with a settable
                friction control to prevent inadvertent movement. The collective changes
                the pitch angle of all the main rotor blades collectively (i.e. all at the
                same time) and independently of their position. Therefore, if a collective
                input is made, all the blades change equally, and the result is the
                helicopter increasing or decreasing in altitude. A swashplate controls the
                collective and cyclic pitch of the main blades. The swashplate moves up
                and down, along the main shaft, to change the pitch of both blades. This
                causes the helicopter to push air downward or upward, depending on the
                angle of attack. The swashplate can also change its angle to move the
                blades angle forwards or backwards, or left and right, to make the
                helicopter move in those directions.

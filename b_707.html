            A narrow-body aircraft or single-aisle aircraft is an airliner arranged
            along a single aisle, permitting up to 6-abreast seating in a cabin less
            than 4 metres (13 ft) in width. The highest seating capacity of a
            narrow-body aircraft is 295 passengers in the Boeing 757–300.

            USAF and NATO E-3s have an unrefueled range of 7,400 km (4,600 mi) or 8 hours of flying. The newer E-3 versions bought by France, Saudi Arabia, and the UK are equipped with newer CFM56-2 turbofan engines, and these can fly for about 11 hours or more than 9,250 km (5,750 mi).

      First flight: EC-137D: 9 February 1972; E-3: 25 May 1976

            <p><dd> In 1963, the USAF asked for proposals for an Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) to replace its EC-121 Warning Stars, which had served in the airborne early warning role for over a decade. </dd>
                <dd> The new aircraft would take advantage of improvements in radar technology and computer-aided radar data analysis and data reduction. These developments allowed airborne radars to "look down". </dd>
                <dd> to detect the movement of low-flying aircraft, and discriminate, even over land, target aircraft's movements; previously this had been impossible due to the inability to discriminate an aircraft's track from ground clutter.</dd>
                <dd> Contracts were issued to Boeing, Douglas, and Lockheed, the latter being eliminated in July 1966. In 1967, a parallel program was put into place to develop the radar, with Westinghouse Electric Corporation and Hughes Aircraft being asked to compete in producing the radar system.</dd><dd>- In 1968, it was referred to as Overland Radar Technology (ORT) during development tests on the modified EC-121Q. </dd>
                <dd> Approval was given on 26 January 1973 for the full-scale development of the AWACS system. To allow further development of the aircraft's systems, orders were placed for three preproduction aircraft, the first of which performed its maiden flight in February 1975. IBM and Hazeltine were selected to develop the mission computer and display system. The IBM computer was designated 4PI, and the software was written in JOVIAL.</dd><dd>- A Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) or back-up interceptor control (BUIC) operator would immediately be at home with the track displays and tabular displays, but differences in symbology would create compatibility problems in tactical ground radar systems in Iceland, mainland Europe, and South Korea over Link-11 (TADIL-A). In 1977, Iran placed an order for ten E-3s, however this order was cancelled following the Iranian Revolution.</dd>

            <p><dd> Because the Boeing 707 is no longer in production, the E-3 mission package has been fitted into the Boeing E-767 for the Japan Air Self Defense Forces. </dd><dd>- The E-10 MC2A was intended to replace USAF E-3s—along with the RC-135 and the E-8 Joint STARS, <br> but the program was canceled by the Department of Defense.</p>
